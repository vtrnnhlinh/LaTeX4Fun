\section*{Acknowledgments}

My summer internship has come to an end, and I am filled with gratitude for the journey and the people who have been a part of it.

First and foremost, I want to epxress my sincere gratitude to Vierobot Company for providing an exciting and dynamic working environment. I am also profoundly thankful to Mr. Pham Son Loc for giving me the opportunity to work here. As my mentor, he offered invaluable feedback and guidance, shaping my engineering mindset. His insights and advice have been truly transformative. To me, he is not only a mentor but also a role model.

It would be a shame not to mention my colleagues. They are exceptionally professional, skilled, and talented engineers. Their unwavering support and feedback enriched my internship experience immeasurably.

Secondly, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my university, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (VNU-HCM). Thank you for facilitating this internship opportunity, enabling me to work at Vierobot. I am also deeply grateful to MEng. Hoang Le Hai Thanh for being my advisor, offering guidance and support throughout this journey.

Last but certainly not least, I wish to express my deepest thankfulness to my family and friends. They are the most wonderful and supportive people in the world. Thank you for standing by me through every challenge and triumph.

Sincerely,

Linh.
